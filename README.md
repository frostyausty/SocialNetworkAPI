# SocialNetworkAPI


## Description

This repository contains a social network API built with MongoDB and Mongoose. Using Insomnia, you are able to create a user, update a user's information, view all users, view a single user, and delete users. Similarly, you can create thoughts (like a tweet), update a thought, view all thoughts created by users, view a single thought, as well as delete them. Users can also add other users as a friend, and post reactions on thoughts. Below is a video demonstrating the functionality.
